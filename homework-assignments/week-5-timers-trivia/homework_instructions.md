### Remember

You will be fully capable of doing this homework by the end of Saturday's class.


### Setup
  1. Create a folder called `TriviaGame`
  2. Create a file inside of the `TriviaGame` folder called `index.html`. Your page's HTML will go in here.
  3. Create a folder inside of the `TriviaGame` folder called `assets`.
  4. Inside `assets`: create three folders: `css`, `javascript`, `images`
  5. Create a `style.css` in your `css` folder. Place your CSS in here.
  6. Create an `app.js` file in your `javascript` folder. Write your JavaScript in here.
  7. Choose what game to build. Either the basic one or the advanced one.

  #### Your HTML file
    Don't forget to include jQuery, [reset.css](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/reset.css), `style.css` and `app.js` files you created.


### Basic Assignment User Story
* You are creating a basic trivia game with multiple choice or true/false options.
* The player will have a limited time length to finish the game. When the time runs out (regardless of whether or not they finished), the game will end and they will be shown the number of answers they got correct and incorrect.
* There will be a counter counting down the remaining time.
* The player should NOT be able to pick more than one answer for each question.

### Advanced Assignment User Story
* Only one question will be shown at a time.
* The time limit will apply to each question, and when the time runs out, the game will show a screen with the correct answer, and then move on to the next question without user input.
* If the user chooses the correct answer, the game will show a screen letting them know the answer was correct, and then move on to the next question without user input.
* If the user chooses the incorrect answer, the game will show a screen with the correct answer, and then move on to the next question without user input.
* On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).

### Finally
* Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!
