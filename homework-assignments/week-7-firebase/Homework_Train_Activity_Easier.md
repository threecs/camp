# Week 7 Assignment - Train Scheduler (Easier)

##### *Because that Rock Paper Scissors Game is Too Damn Hard*

### Objectives
* You will create a Firebase backed train schedule application

* You will use HTML, CSS, and jQuery to render the schedule and admin panel on the web page.

* You will use Firebase to host a globally available set of data that will be retrieved and manipulated using Moment.js to provide up-to-date information about various trains' arrival times and minutes to arrival.

* You will look at the screenshot of the finished app to get a grasp of the finished product. 

-----


### Setup
  1. However you like. Just make sure you are using Firebase to store data.

### Basic Assignment Notes
  * When adding trains, administrators should be able to include: Train Name, Destination, First Train Time (military time), and frequency (minutes).
  * The app should have code able to use this basic information and self-determine when the next train is to arrive relative to the current time. 
  * This app must be such that multiple users from -- many different machines can all view the same times simultaneously.

### Finally
  * Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!

### Bonus (Extra Challenges)
  * For an extra challenge, consider making your app such that the "minutes to arrival" and "next train time" update on the screen on their own (without refresh). This is significantly more challenging, so only attempt this if you've completed the actual activity and committed it somewhere on GitHub for safekeeping.
  * For another extra challenge, consider making your app such that there are update/remove buttons for each train. Make it so that you can update a row and change its Name, Destination, Arrival Time (and then by relation -- minutes to arrival).
  * For a final challenge, read up on Firebase authentication and make it so that only Authenticated users (via Google or Github) are able to add new trains.
