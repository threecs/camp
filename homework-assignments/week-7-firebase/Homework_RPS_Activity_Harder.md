### Setup
  1. Create a folder called `RPS-Multiplayer`
  2. Create a file inside of the `RPS-Multiplayer` folder called `index.html`. Your page's HTML will go in here.
  2. Create a folder inside of the `RPS-Multiplayer` folder called `assets`.
  2. Inside `assets`: create three folders: `css`, `javascript`, `images` (if you plan to use images)
  3. Create a `style.css` in your `css` folder. Place your CSS in here.
  4. Create an `app.js` file in your `javascript` folder. Write your JavaScript in here.


  #### Your HTML file
  Don't forget to include [jQuery](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.1.min.js), [reset.css](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/reset.css), [Firebase](https://cdn.firebase.com/js/client/2.4.1/firebase.js), and the `style.css` and `app.js` files you created.


### Basic Assignment User Story
  * Only two users can play at the same time.
  * Each player chooses a move and then is told whether they won, lost, or there was a tie.
  * Each player's wins and losses will be tracked.
  * Throw some chat functionality in there, because no internet game is complete without having to endure endless taunts and insults from your opponent.


### Finally
  * Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!
