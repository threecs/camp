# AnimalTastic

We're going to make an AnimalTastic Fun App full of gifs using the giphy api!!!

Here is the documentation for the Giphy API: https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI

### Step 1 - Hit the GIPHY API

Fool around with the Giphy API. You can read more here: https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI#search-endpoint

Read about these parameters (hint, hint): 
* `q`
* `limit`
* `rating`

The public API Key is provided here: https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI#overview.

### Step 2 - Watch the demo video

Watch the homework demo video to see how this homework would look.

### Step 3 - Make an array of things

* We made an array of animals and made buttons out of them. You should choose a list of your own liking. Maybe it's tv shows or musicians.

* When you click on a button, we get 10 images from giphy and put them on the page. 

* When you click on the image, the gif plays. When you click again, the gif stops playing.

* You can use a form that takes the value and puts it into the array and remakes the buttons on the page.

* Display the rating of the image on the page (PG, G, etc...). This data is provided by the giphy api.

### Step 4 - Rejoice

You made something really cool.
