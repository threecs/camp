# Week 11 Assignment

### Objectives
* Recreate Hangman using constructors, objects and Node.js
* Process user input via the command line

### Instructions
1. Create a new folder called `Week11-Hangman`

2. Inside the `Week11-Hangman` folder, create the following: 
  * Make files called `game.js`, `letter.js`, `main.js`, and `word.js`
  * Using these files, you are going to be putting together a console-based hangman application which utilizes constructors, objects, and user-input in its solution.
  * The application should select a random word from the `game.js`
  * Both `letter.js` and `word.js` should be constructor files:
    * `word.js` should contain all of the methods which will check the letters guessed versus the random word selected.
    * `letter.js` should control whether or not a letter appears as a "_" or as itself on-screen.
  * `main.js` is where the game is played and contains all of the user-input.
    * The application should end when a player successfully guesses a word or runs out of guesses.

### Tips

1. Solve it one peice at a time! Break it down into smaller problems that add up to solve the "bigger problem". Step 1 Focus on one part of the smaller problem and get some code working. Step 2 Rinse and repeat.  `console.log` is your friend.
2. Try your best to deliver a 'working/playable game' by the end of the deadline.
3. `git commit` often. Turn in anything you have! Don't get an automatic 0!
