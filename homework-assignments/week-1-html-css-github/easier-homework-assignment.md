### Overview

### Student Notes
* This homework assignment should only be completed if you put forward a significant effort on the Recommended Portoflio Assignment but were unable to make progress. This assignment is a good place to learn the fundamentals of HTML/CSS layout and positioning, but it would still be worth your time to attempt the Portfolio assignment as it offers additional exposure to the use of HTML/CSS for creating aesthetic designs (critical skills for a future front-end developer). 

* Dont' be fooled! Just because this is the "easier" assignment -- it won't necessarily be an assignment you can do quickly. If this is your first time with HTML/CSS, be ready to put some time into it! The process of learning web development is all about investing time. The more time you put in the more comfortable you will be.

### Instructions
1. Create a new repository in GitHub called `HW-Wireframe`.
2. Go through the process explained in class to clone this repository to your local computer. 
3. Then navigate to the folder created on your computer and create two files inside: one called `index.html` and one called `style.css`.
4. Once again, follow the GitHub guide provided to you in class, to do an initial `git add -A`, `git commit -m "<COMMENT>`, and `git push origin master` to upload these two files into GitHub. If this process was done correctly, you should see these two files appear in GitHub. This will be your initial test to confirm that you are hooked into GitHub. 
5. Now return to your local copies of `index.html` and `style.css`. Then, using the screenshot provided above attempt to re-create the design using HTML/CSS. All of your HTML should be inside of the `index.html` file and all of the css should be inside of the `style.css`.
6. When you are done with your assignment, once again run the commands `git add -A`, `git commit -m "<COMMENT"`, and `git push origin master` to upload your c hanges to GitHub. 

### Additional Specifications:
1. Your HTML should have each of the following sections: 
    * Header
    * Nav
    * Aside
    * Section
    * Article with a Heading
    * Headers
    * Paragraph
2. Your css should have styles for each of the following elements:
    * body
    * header, nav, section, aside, footer
    * section
    * aside
    * article
    * .clear
    * h1, p
3. The colors used in your final layout should be:
    * Background: #777
    * Content: #ebebeb
4. The widths of each section should be:
    * body: 960px
    * section: 495px
5. The fonts used in the layout should be:
    * font-family: 'Arial', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;
    * font-size 18px


### Helpful Hints:
* Be sure to consult the GitHub Supplemental Guide sent to you in class when interfacing with GitHub.
* Don't forget to look into the concepts of: `float`, `padding`, `margin`, `display`, `overflow`, `clear`, and `text-align`
* Consult with TAs and Instructors if you find yourself completely stumped for more than a few hours. Get help when you need it! That's why you're in the program :-)
* Stay positive!
