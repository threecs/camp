# 23 - 3 Languages in 3 Days

### Overview

The purpose of this unit is to introduce you to three major languages other than JavaScript: Java, Python, and Ruby.

### Lesson Plans

* [23.1 - Lesson Plan](1-Class-Content/23.1/23.1-LessonPlan.md)

* [23.2 - Lesson Plan](1-Class-Content/23.2/23.2-LessonPlan.md)

* [23.3 - Lesson Plan](1-Class-Content/23.3/23.3-LessonPlan.md)

### Homework Activities

You have no homework this week. But, if you're so inclined, you are encouraged to implement this week's activities in the language of your choosing. We enthusiastically recommend [Clojurescript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript); [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/); and [C#](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z1zx9t92.aspx).

### Key Activities

Each lesson implements the same console application, but in a different language. The terminal activity of each lesson plan introduces each language's object-oriented capacities, culminating in the cleanest implementation students produce. This is the activity linked here.
