## Week 21 - React Native

### Overview
In this week, we'll explore the React Native framework. This spin on Facebook's React library lets developers create iOS and Android apps, but the learning curve is steep -- be prepared to spend extra time studying the syntax and makeup of a standard React Native project. We'll end the week with a day dedicated to final projects.
