<!-- 
	1. There are two things wrong with this code. Please fix it. At the end, the page should show:
		Steve Prefontaine said "A lot of people run a race to see who is fastest. I run to see who has the most guts, who can punish himself into exhausting pace, and then at the end, punish himself even more."

	2. Instead of JavaScript, refactor the below code to use jQuery

-->
<head>
	<title></title>

<body>

	<div>Come at me bro</div>
	<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript">
	$(document).ready(function(){
		var runner = {
				runnerName: 'Steve Prefontaine',
				runnerSpeak: function(){
					var name = this.runnerName;

					var quote = "\"A lot of people run a race to see who is fastest. I run to see who has the most guts, who can punish himself into exhausting pace, and then at the end, punish himself even more.\""

					return name + " said " + quote;
				}
			}
			$('div').html(runner.runnerSpeak());
	});
		/*window.onload = function(){
			var runner = {
