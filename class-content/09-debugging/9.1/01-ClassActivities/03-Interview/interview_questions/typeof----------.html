//1. Consider the following code:

console.log(typeof null);
console.log(typeof {});
console.log(typeof []);
console.log(typeof undefined);
//What’s the output?
























/*

Solution:

The previous question seems a bit silly but it tests the knowledge of the typeof operator. A lot of JavaScript developers aren’t aware of some peculiarities of typeof. In this example, the console will display the following:

object
object
object
undefined
The most surprising output is probably the third. Most developers expect typeof [] to return Array. In case you want to test if a variable contains an array, you can perform the following test:

var myArray = [];
if (myArray instanceof Array) {
   // do something...
}
