//1. What is the result of the following code? Explain your answer.

Solution:

The output of the code is:

1
4
3
2

To understand why the numbers are printed in this order, you have to understand what setTimeout() does and how the browser’s event loop works. The browser has an event loop which checks the event queue and processes pending events. UI events (such as click, scroll, and so on), Ajax callbacks, and callback provided to setTimeout() and setInterval() are all processed one at a time by the event loop. Therefore, when calling the setTimeout() function the callback provided is queued, even if the delay specified is zero. The callback stays in the queue until the time specified has elapsed and the engine is ready to perform the action (i.e. if it isn’t performing another action at the moment). So, although a callback passed to setTimeout() is delayed by zero milliseconds, it’ll be queued and executed after other non-delayed statements declared in the same function.

With this in mind it’s easy to understand that “1” is printed first because it’s the first statement of the function and it’s not delayed using the setTimeout() function. Then, we have “4” because it’s the first non-delayed number to print, so it isn’t queued, after the delayed ones. Now, there are “2” and “3” left. Both have been added to the queue but while the former has to wait one second, the latter can be printed after 0 seconds (which means instantaneously after the engine has completed all the other processes). This explains why “3” is printed before “2”.
