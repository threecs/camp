## 12.1 Lesson Plan - Messing With MySQL

### Overview
MySQL, while extremely useful and powerful, is unlike any other programming language your students have encountered thus far and will undoubtedly lead to some confusion. As if that were not enough, MySQL brings with it its own unique set of stumbling blocks that can blindside you and trip your class up if you are not prepared for them. Do not worry though, as we are here to help guide you through this opening to one of the web's most powerful server-side storage tools.

##### Instructor Priorities:
* Get MySQL Workbench up and running on everyone's computers
* Walk students through the creation of a localhost connection to MySQL on their devices
* Students should know how to create and use a MySQL database to store data in tables
* Students should be able to create and select data from tables using the SQL editor

##### Instructor's Notes:
* Today's class is most likely not going to be an easy one. As mentioned in the overview above, there are a lot of hurdles which can both intimidate and block students from wanting to dive into and mess around with MySQL. It does not help that, unlike Sublime, MySQL does not have the friendliest of designs and seems somewhat cluttered. Make sure to keep your class calm and reassure them that all of this will make more sense as they spend more time with the language.

* Since MySQL has the potential to bring about a lot of errors on its inaugural setup, we have set aside portions of time for the critical assignments for you and your TA's to assist the class as necessary over the course of today's assignments. If some students finish the assignments without issue, then have them also go around and assist those who are still facing problems. Do your best to keep everyone in the class on the same page so that no one is left behind.

* **A few days before this class, tell everyone in your class over Slack to download MySQL Workbench so that everyone is using the same program when they get to class!**

-------

### Class Objectives
* To have MySQL Workbench installed and running on everyone's computers
* To create a localhost connection to a MySQL server and have everyone successfully connect to it
* To successfully create, use, and populate a MySQL database with data
* To successfully create, populate, and select data from a MySQL table

-------

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Class (2 mins)
* Welcome the class to class and congratulate them on making it to the halfway point of the course! They have come very far since they began and are well on their way to becoming true full-stack developers with their newfound front-end skills!

* Warn them that today's class will be going over something entirely new, however, and that it may take them some time to pick up this new language since it is almost entirely unlike any of the other programs they have learned up to this point.

* Tell them not to worry though as, despite the difficulties many may face over the course of the class, there will be ample time given to make sure everyone is on the same page.

### 2. Instructor Do: Introduction to SQL and MySQL (5 mins)
* Before diving into any of this lesson's demos or even having the students install MySQL Workbench on their devices, take some time to go over the purpose SQL and MySQL.

* SQL (often pronounced "Sequel") stands for "Structured Query Language" and is a powerful programming tool that was specifically designed to allow programmers with the ability to create, populate, manipulate, and access databases so as to provide them with an easy method to deal with server-side storage.

* MySQL (often pronounced "My Sequel") is a popular type of open source software that can be placed on a server so as to allow SQL commands to affect the data stored on the server.

* Data using SQL is stored in tables on the server much like those you would create in microsoft excel or in google spreadsheets, making the data easy to visualize and search through.

### 3. Everyone Do: Install MySQL Workbench (5 mins)
* Announce to the class that, in order to code in MySQL, they will require a coding environment other than that of Sublime.

* Slack out the link to [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) and tell your class to download this new program.

* Make sure that everyone has MySQL Workbench installed and booted up before continuing the lesson.

### 4. Instructor Do: Creating a Localhost Connection Demo (10 mins)
* Explain to the class how, since we do not have a defined server for them to connect to, we are going to set up something called a "localhost connection" for them to use.

	* This type of connection allows us to create locally stored data on our computers as if they were an external server.

	* This is a much better alternative to spending hundreds to thousands of dollars on buying a server itself for the purposes of practicing on.

* Open up MySQL Workbench and click the (+) symbol next to the text which reads "MySQL Connections"

	* Enter "Local Instance MySQL" as your connection name

	* Make sure your connection is set to "Standard (TCP/IP)"

	* Enter "localhost" as the Hostname

	* Enter "3306" as the port for your connection. You can leave this part out of the connection and it could still work.

	* Enter your MySQL username into the Username section (Default is "root")

	* Click on the "Store In Vault..." button beside the Password option and enter in your MySQL password (Default is empty)

	* Leave the Default Schema field empty

		* ![New Connection](Images/New_Connection.png)

* Click on the "Test Connection" button so as to ensure that you have properly connected to your new localhost connection. If successful, hit okay and your new connection should appear on the main page.

* Now double-click on that connection, enter your password if necessary, and the SQL editor will appear.

* Check to see if there are any questions and answer them to the best of your ability.

### 5. Students Do: Creating a Localhost Connection (10 - 30 mins)
* Let the class know that MySQL Workbench can sometimes seem a little hard to comprehend when loaded up for the first time and that confusion is perfectly normal.

* Also let them know that there are some errors that are likely to pop up over the course of this assignment but that you and the TA's will be walking around to help them with whatever issues make themselves known.

	* Students who have successfully created a localhost connection should be encouraged to help those who seem to be struggling as well, especially if they happened upon the same kind of error that the struggling student is having.

	* If they feel they cannot help their fellow students, have them start reading up on how databases are created and used in MySQL.

* Slack out the following instructions...

* **Instructions**

	* Now it is your turn to set up a localhost connection! This may seem as if it will be an easy task, but there are some common errors and hurdles that might stand in your way as you work to create your first ever MySQL connection.

	* Start out by opening up MySQL and hitting the (+) button next to the text which reads "MySQL Connections"

	* Enter the following credentials into the on-screen prompt...

		* Connection Name: Local Instance MySQL

		* Connection Method: Standard (TCP/IP)

		* Hostname: localhost

		* Port: 3306

		* Username: <Your MySQL Username> (Defaults to "root")

		* Password: <Your MySQL Password> (Defaults to empty)

		* Keep the Default Schema field empty

	* Hit "Test Connection" and, if the connection is successful, hit okay and double-click on the newly created field under the "MySQL Connections" text on the home page

		* If the connection fails, raise your hand and one of us will come around to help you out. Until we come by, however, take this time to go online and see if there is anything online which might tell you what went wrong. Do not worry if you cannot find anything though, we will make sure to figure this out.

	* If your connection was successful and you have nothing else to do, feel free to help those around you in creating their connections.

	* BONUS: Look into how you can create and use databases using SQL commands

	* BONUS: Look into the reasons why MySQL uses port 3306 as its default

### 6. Instructor Do: Connections Vs. Databases (3 mins)
* Now that everyone has created a connection to the localhost and is comfortably inside the SQL editor, ask your students whether or not this means that they have created a database as well.

* The answer is that they have not... Yet.

	* Point out how the "SCHEMAS" section on the left side of their page is pretty much empty other than including the built-in sys, sakila, and world databases. These databases would not appear on external servers.

		* ![Schemas](Images/Schemas.png)

* Connecting to a server does not mean that you have created a database on that server. This means that, even if we wanted to, we could not yet populate our localhost connection with data until we create a database to house the data.

* The connection is a road which leads to an empty lot. Before we can populate the area, we first need to lay the foundations for houses (create a database), and build the houses (create a table).

### 7. Instructor Do: Creating a MySQL Database (5 mins)
* Within the MySQL Workbench editor, type `CREATE DATABASE animals_db;`

	* Explain to the class how this line of code will, when executed, create a MySQL database on the server they are connected to.

	* Also make certain to point out the semicolon at the end of the statement

* Next, find the lightning-bolt symbol just above the editor and click on it to execute your code.

	* ![SQL Bar](Images/SQL_Bar.png)

* Point out how, on the bottom of the screen, there is a confirmation stating that the database has successfully been created.

	* ![Confirmation](Images/Confirmation.png)

* Something seems off though... See if anyone in the class can figure it out and give them a few seconds to think it through before answering.

	* The database never appeared in the navigator on the left side of the page! Does that mean that our code actually failed?

	* Nope! We just need to reload our connection and the "animals_db" database will now appear within the navigator. We have just successfully created our first-ever database!

### 8. Instructor Do: Creating a Table (10 mins)
* Now that we have got a database, we start digging into the real meat of MySQL and start creating tables within our new database!

* On the line underneath `CREATE DATABASE animals_db;` enter the following lines of code of copy-paste the code from []

```
USE animals_db;

CREATE TABLE people (
name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
has_pet BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
pet_name VARCHAR(30),
pet_age INTEGER(10));
```

* Go through each line and explain what it does. Make sure to touch upon the syntax as well.

	* `USE animals_db;` tells MySQL that all of the code that follows will be affecting the data stored within the "animalsdb" database.

	* `CREATE TABLE pets (<COLUMNS>);` does exactly what it sounds like, it would create a table called "pets" with the columns listed within the parentheses.

	* `owner VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL` creates a column of "owner" which can hold character strings within it of up to 30 characters and will not allow null fields.

	* `has_pet BOOLEAN NOT NULL` creates a column of "has_pet" which can hold either TRUE or FALSE within it and will not allow null fields.

	* `pet_name VARCHAR(30)` creates a column of "pet_name" which can hold character strngs within it of up to 30 characters and will allow null fields.

	* `pet_age INTEGER(10)` creates a column of "pet_age" which can hold whole numbers with precision up to 11 places.

* After going through the code, hit the lightning-bolt button and make note of the error which appears at the bottom of the screen saying that "animals_db" already exists.

	* MySQL data is persistent and therefore is not deleted or overwritten when identical commands are run unless specifically commanded to. This means that when we create a database or table with an identical name to one which already exists, an error will occur telling you that the database/table already exists.

	* Ask your students what they could do to avoid these kinds of errors. They will most likely come up with the fact that you could simply delete that line of code and then run the commands again - which would work - but point out how deleting working code is not something you want to get into the habit of doing.

	* Instead, show them how you can actually highlight the lines of code you wish to be run and then click the lightning-bolt symbol to only run the selected portion. This is a much better method of running SQL code than deleting past code.

		* ![Highlight](Images/Highlighting.png)

* Highlight the above code and then hit the lightning-bolt symbol to run it. Reload your connection to the server and, using the navigator, point out how there is now a table called "people" in our database.

### 9. Students Do: Setting Up FavoriteDB (10 mins)

* Slack out the following file and instructions

* **Instructions**

	* You're going to be putting your new SQL skills to the test by creating FavoriteDB; a database which has three tables in it that will hold your favorite foods, songs, and movies.

	* For the table favorite_foods...
		* Create the column "food" which can take in a 50 character string and cannot be NULL
		* Create the column "score" which can take in an integer

	* For the table favorite_songs...
		* Create the column "song" which can take in a 100 character string and cannot be NULL
		* Create the column "artist" which can take in a 50 character string
		* Create the column "score" which can take in an integer

	* For the table favorite_movies...
		* Create the column "film" which can take in a string and cannot be NULL
		* Create the column "five_times" which can take in a boolean
		* create the column "score" which can take in an integer

	* BONUS: Go online and look into how one might go about adding data into a table.

### 10. Everyone Do: Go Over FavoriteDB (5 mins)

* Copy and paste the data inside of [favoriteDB.SQL](Activities/2-FavoriteDB-NoData/FavoriteDB.SQL) into MySQL Workbench to go over what each line of code does once more.

* Especially make sure to point out how `DEFAULT`, `PRIMARY KEY`, and `AUTO_INCREMENT` work in this example as they will certainly help with the homework and can make SQL a whole lot easier to handle.

----------

### 11. BREAK TIME (15 mins)

----------

### 12. Adding and Updating Data In Tables (15 mins)

* Once everyone is back from break, ask the class whether or not there is any data in our tables yet?

	* The answer is, of course, that there is still no data stored within the server. Unlike before, however, we are now all set to start adding data into our tables!

* Open up "animals_db" once more within MySQL Workbench and type `SELECT * FROM animals_db;` into the editor before highlighting this line of code and running it. Explain this to your students as you type in the code.

* This will bring up a visual of the table we have created and students should note that there is nothing stored within the table just yet. We will be changing this now.

	* ![Table View](Images/Table_View.png)

* Moving back into the editor, type the following code into it while explaining what it does.

```
INSERT INTO people (name,has_pet,pet_name,pet_age)
VALUES ("Ahmed",TRUE,"Rockington",100);

SELECT * FROM people;
```

* This code does pretty much what it says on the tin, it inserts data into the "people" table and then specifies what columns that data will be entered into. Values then places the data contained in the parentheses into the corresponding columns listed after the INSERT INTO statement.

* Enter the following code into the editor above the select statement and below the pervious statement. Before running the three statements, however, ask the class what they think will happen to the table.

```
INSERT INTO people (name,has_pet,pet_name,pet_age)
VALUES ("Jacob",TRUE,"Misty",10);
```

* The code WILL run, but as you can see, the data from the first insert statement has been duplicated. This is because, unlike tables and databases, there can be identical data stored within a table. As such, students should make sure to be careful when adding insert statements into their code.

* Write the following lines of code into the editor underneath the last insert statement and ask the class what they think will happen to the table

```
INSERT INTO people (name,has_pet)
VALUES ("Peter",FALSE);
```

* Highlight this line of code and the select statement to show how data has been added to only the "name" and "has_pet" columns of the table while the rest of the row has null values. This is because we filled only those columns that required data while those that did not require data were automatically filled with null values.

	* If we were to try and create a new row in our without filling those columns requiring data, the code would return an error and would not be able to run.

* Oh! It looks like Peter actually DOES have a pet and we should probably change the data in our table to reflect this! Write the following statement and then see if anyone can figure out what it would do.

```
UPDATE people
SET has_pet=TRUE,
WHERE name="Peter";
```

* This code updates the data stored in the columns specified in the the SET statement in the row where the data in the "name" column is equal to "Peter"

	* If we did not include that WHERE statement, then our UPDATE would have set the values for all columns instead of those of a specific row. That would have been a pretty major error and is why the WHERE statement is so important.

### 13. Students Do: Adding Data to FavoriteDB (10 Mins)

* Slack out the following instructions

* **Instructions**

	* It is time to add some data into FavoriteDB! The data that you add should be unique to you and you should try to test your skills in not only adding new data, but also attempt to update old data as well!

	* Try to add at least three rows of data to each table.

	* BONUS: Look into how you you might go about creating a column that can hold a default value within it and how default values work when creating new rows.

	* BONUS: Look into how you might go about creating a column with a default value that automatically go up with each new row

	* BONUS: Look into the concept of making something a column into being the "primary key"

	* ULTRA BONUS: Try to create a column called "id" in one of your tables that can contain an integer, is the primary key for the table, cannot be NULL, and automatically increments with each new row added.

### 14. Instructor Do: The Value of Unique Values (5 Mins)

* You know, that duplicate data in our table is starting to become something of an eyesore... Let's change that! Type in the following line of code which should remove the rows that contain the string "Ahmed" within the "name" column.

```
DELETE FROM people
WHERE name='Ahmed';
```

* Well... It deleted the duplicate! Too bad it also deleted the original row as well. That's a little annoying. See if the class understands why this happened.

	* Because the name "Ahmed" appears twice within the table, SQL assumes that we want to delete every column that contains that name and does not understand that we are simply trying to delete the duplicate.

* To prevent this kind of thing from occuring, programmers will oftentimes want to create a column that automatically populates each new row with unique data. This allows them to select and affect that row more easily.

* Open up [animals_dbWithID.sql](Activities/3-animals_dbWithID/animals_dbWithID.SQL) and copy the code into MySQL Workbench before running it.

	* Be sure to note how we have now replaced our old update statement with one in which the WHERE statement now uses the id column to select the row we want to affect. This is because using the primary key to update something is far safer than using another column.

	* Also note how our insert statements have not changed since we do not need to insert data specifically into the id column. It will automatically add data into it.

* We purposefully included the same kind of error that we had within the other code where there are two identical rows. Thanks to the auto-incrementing primary key of id, however, we can now more easily remove the duplicate through using the following code.

```
DELETE FROM people
WHERE id=2;
```

* This does precisely what we wanted it to! There is only one Ahmed left and his clone has been destroyed! Long live the original Ahmed!

### 15. Students Do: Making and Using an ID Column (10 mins)

* Slack out the following instructions

* **Instructions**

	* Make a new database called "programming_db" and switch into it for this activity

	* Create a table called "programming_languages" which includes a primary key named "id" which will automatically increment which each new row created, a string column called "languages," and a numeric column called "rating."

	* Insert some data into the table and then modify the data using the id column.

	* BONUS: Study up on how to add columns to a table and then create a boolean column called "mastered" which has a default value of TRUE.

	* BONUS: Start looking into the concept of joins in SQL

### 16. Everyone Do: programming_db Solution (5 mins)

* Open up [programmingDB](Activities/4-programmingDB/programmingDB.sql) and copy the code into MySQL Workbench

* Go over the bits of code which create "id" and set it as the primary key once more. Make sure everyone understands how this works and explain how useful this will be in this week's homework

### 17. Instructor Do: Breaking Into the Joint (10 mins)

* Now we are getting into one of the more difficult aspects of MySQL, but tell your class that this information will be very useful to them in the homework should they decide to attempt the challenge assignment.

* Joins allow those using MySQL to combine two or more individual tables together using a value that is shared between them.

* Open up [favoriteDBWithData](Activities/5-favoriteDBWithData/favoriteDBWithData.sql) and then copy it into MySQL Workbench.

* Point out the new pieces of code at the bottom which can be used to combine the three tables together into a table of all our favorite things! Pretty neat!

* INNER JOIN: Combines tables where the specified data-values within a column match one-another

* LEFT JOIN: Combines tables and shows all of the values of the first table specified while only the values which match on the second side will be shown

* RIGHT JOIN: Combines tables and shows all of the values of the second table specified while only the values which match on the first table will be shown
